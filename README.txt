X3D for Web Authors is an introductory reference textbook for learning
Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics.  Building and interacting with 3D graphics
is a "hands on" experience. Throughout this book there are lots of examples
to study and modify. Practice helps you learn how X3D works, and assists you
in building your own projects. 

Book support includes the X3D-Edit authoring tool, X3D Tooltips, X3D Validator,
complete course slidesets and videos, plus this open-source model archive.
Source changes are maintained in version control and bug tracking is online.
